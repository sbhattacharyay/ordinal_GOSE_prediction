## Overview

This repository contains the code underlying the article entitled **The leap to ordinal: An artificially intelligent approach to predict nuanced functional outcomes in critically ill patients with traumatic brain injury** from the Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in TBI ([CENTER-TBI](https://www.center-tbi.eu/)) consortium. In this file, we present the abstract, to outline the motivation for the work and the findings, and then a brief description of the code with which we generate these finding and achieve this objective.\
\
The code on this repository is commented throughout to provide a description of each step alongside the code which achieves it.

## Abstract

## Code 
All of the code used in this work can be found in the `./scripts` directory as Python (`.py`), R (`.R`), or bash (`.sh`) scripts. Moreover, custom classes have been saved in the `./scripts/classes` sub-directory, custom functions have been saved in the `./scripts/functions` sub-directory, and custom PyTorch models have been saved in the `./scripts/models`.
